âœ… **Streaming Support**: Added support for large-scale data processing

### Remaining Tasks for v1.0.0:
- Finalize documentation for all public APIs
- Complete benchmarking across different hardware configurations
- Perform final dependency audit and optimization
- Freeze API interfaces and prepare migration guides
- Release candidate testing (targeting August 2025)

## Dependency Optimization

### Core Objectives
- Reduce the total number of required dependencies
- Minimize version conflicts with other packages
- Make as many dependencies optional as possible
- Provide clear installation paths for different use cases

### Planned Changes
1. **Modular Dependency Structure**

   - Create specialized installation profiles (e.g., "minimal", "nlp", "viz")
   - Split large dependencies from the core package

2. **Alternative Implementations**
   - Provide fallbacks for functionality when optional dependencies are missing
   - Implement dependency-free alternatives for common operations
   - Add runtime checks with helpful error messages when dependencies are missing

3. **Embedding Optimization**
   - Make embedding models entirely optional
   - Support loading from local files to avoid network dependencies
   - Use smaller, more efficient models as defaults
   - Support for quantized models to reduce memory usage

4. **Visualization Standalone Mode**
   - Separate visualization dependencies from core functionality
   - Support for generating visualizations with minimal dependencies
   - Export options for different visualization libraries
