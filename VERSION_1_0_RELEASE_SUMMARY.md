# Meno v1.0.0 Release Summary

## Overview

Meno v1.0.0 represents our first stable API release with long-term support. This version standardizes our interfaces, making the API more consistent and user-friendly.

## Completed Tasks

### API Standardization

- ✅ Standardized parameter naming:
  - Replaced all `n_topics` parameters with `num_topics` throughout codebase
  - Added backward compatibility attributes for smooth transition
  - Made parameter names consistent across all modules

- ✅ Standardized visualization parameters:
  - Updated all visualization functions to use `width` and `height` instead of `figsize`
  - Made size parameters consistent across all visualization modules
  - Fixed the visualization modules in enhanced_viz directory

- ✅ Standardized method signatures:
  - Renamed `search_topics` to `find_similar_topics` across all implementations
  - Added common interface methods to BaseTopicModel
  - Added proper Path object handling for file operations
  - Updated all save/load methods to use consistent patterns

- ✅ Standardized return types:
  - Made all transform() methods return consistent Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]
  - Standardized visualization function returns to always be Plotly figures
  - Documented return types consistently in docstrings

### Breaking Changes

- ✅ Removed legacy code:
  - Keeping only backward compatibility during transition phase
  - Removed redundant parameter mapping
  - Improved error messages for API changes

### Core Architecture Improvements

- ✅ Updated BaseTopicModel abstract base class:
  - Added proper abstract methods with standardized signatures
  - Implemented automatic topic detection
  - Added runtime validation for critical method returns
  - Improved API version tracking

- ✅ Enhanced model features:
  - Added automatic topic detection to all models
  - Improved embedding model handling and customization
  - Enhanced performance on large datasets

### Documentation

- ✅ Added MIGRATION_GUIDE.md with comprehensive instructions
- ✅ Updated VERSION_NOTES.md with full details of v1.0.0 changes
- ✅ Added example showing the new standardized API
- ✅ Updated all docstrings to reflect the standardized parameters
