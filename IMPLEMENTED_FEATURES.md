# Implemented Features for v0.9.1

## 1. API Standardization

We've implemented comprehensive API standardization to ensure a consistent, intuitive developer experience:

- **BaseTopicModel Integration**:
  - Made `UnifiedTopicModeler` properly inherit from the `BaseTopicModel` abstract base class
  - Standardized the base interface for all topic modeling approaches
  - Ensured consistent method signatures across all implementations

- **Parameter Naming Consistency**:
  - Standardized parameter names across all topic model implementations (`n_topics` vs `num_topics`)
  - Created consistent visualization parameter names (`width`, `height`, `colorscale`, etc.)
  - Normalized configuration parameter hierarchies
  - Added parameter name conversion to maintain backward compatibility

- **Return Value Standardization**:
  - Ensured consistent return types for `transform()` methods (`Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]`)
  - Standardized DataFrame column names for topic information
  - Normalized visualization return values

- **Documentation and Guidelines**:
  - Created comprehensive `api_standardization.md` with guidelines
  - Added consistent NumPy-style docstrings throughout the codebase
  - Enhanced type hints for better IDE integration
  - Added examples demonstrating the standardized API

## 2. Team Configuration System

We've implemented a comprehensive team configuration system that allows organizations to:

- Create, share, and manage domain-specific knowledge
- Export and import acronyms and spelling dictionaries
- Compare configurations between teams
- Merge knowledge from multiple teams
- Track sources and versioning of domain knowledge

### Key Components:

- **`meno.utils.team_config`**: Core utilities for team configuration management
  - `create_team_config()`: Create new team configurations with domain-specific knowledge
  - `update_team_config()`: Update existing configurations with new knowledge
  - `merge_team_configs()`: Combine knowledge from multiple team configurations
  - `compare_team_configs()`: Compare configurations to identify differences
  - `get_team_config_stats()`: Analyze configuration contents and metadata

- **Import/Export Functions**:
  - `export_team_acronyms()`: Export acronyms to JSON or YAML files
  - `export_team_spelling_corrections()`: Export spelling corrections to JSON or YAML files
  - `import_acronyms_from_file()`: Import acronyms from external sources
  - `import_spelling_corrections_from_file()`: Import spelling corrections from external sources

## 3. Command-Line Interface for Team Configuration

We've added a command-line interface for team configuration management with the following commands:

- `meno-config create`: Create new team configurations
- `meno-config update`: Update existing configurations
- `meno-config merge`: Merge multiple configurations
- `meno-config compare`: Compare two configurations
- `meno-config stats`: Display statistics about a configuration
- `meno-config export-acronyms`: Export acronyms to a file
- `meno-config export-corrections`: Export spelling corrections to a file

The CLI is implemented in `meno.cli.team_config_cli` and registered as an entry point in `pyproject.toml`.

## 4. Performance Optimizations

We've added several performance optimizations to improve efficiency with large datasets:

- **Memory-Mapped Storage**:
  - Implemented memory-mapped arrays for embedding matrices
  - Created persistent caching system with content-based identifiers
  - Added support for half-precision (float16) storage for 50% memory reduction
  - Implemented UMAP projection caching to avoid recomputation
  - Added configuration options for cache directories and precision

- **Memory-Efficient Embeddings**:
  - Support for quantized embedding models through `optimum` and `bitsandbytes`
  - Configuration options for low-memory operation
  - Smaller default models for reduced resource usage
  - Standardized API for different embedding models

- **Polars Integration**:
  - Added integration with Polars for faster data processing
  - Graceful fallback to pandas when Polars is not available
  - Performance benchmarking utilities
  - Streaming data loading for datasets that don't fit in memory

- **Optimized Workflow**:
  - Added `workflow_with_optimizations.py` example demonstrating memory-mapped storage
  - Implemented memory-efficient data loading with batch processing
  - Added streaming processing capabilities for very large datasets
  - Enhanced caching of embeddings and visualizations to reduce computation time
  - Added progressive visualization loading for large datasets

## 5. System Cleanup and Dependency Management

We've improved dependency management and cleaned up the system:

- **Dependency Organization**:
  - Added `memory_efficient` optional dependency group
  - Enhanced `optimization` dependency group with additional packages
  - Made CLI dependencies explicit
  - Reorganized package directory structure to include new modules

- **System Cleanup**:
  - Removed unused virtual environments
  - Cleaned up temporary files and caches
  - Reduced overall package footprint
  - Made storage more efficient

## 6. Documentation and Planning for v1.0.0

We've added comprehensive documentation for the new features and created a roadmap for the v1.0.0 release:

- Updated README.md with new features and examples
- Added ROADMAP.md outlining the plan for v1.0.0
- Added VERSION_NOTES.md with detailed release notes
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with v0.9.1 changes
- Created examples of API standardization and memory mapping capabilities
- Added comprehensive API standardization guidelines

## 7. Package Updates

We've updated the package metadata for the v0.9.1 release:

- Updated version number in pyproject.toml and __init__.py
- Added new package directories to setuptools configuration
- Added API standardization guidelines to documentation
- Enhanced error messages and warnings
